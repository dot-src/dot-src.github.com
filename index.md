**.src**, a TLD for developers, by developers.

This is a reboot of the excellent [TLD.js](https://github.com/ozten/TLD.js) idea, which turned out not to be possible because of ICANN restrictions on 2-letter TLDs.

This is a work-in-progress project, and we aim for it to grow into the
piece of work that is to apply, pay for and manage a TLD. Everything
must have a beginning.

Principles
----------

.src is...

* Affordable
* Community-driven
* Garbage-free (vs. parked domains, spam, and other garbage; hopefully)

The goal is to have a functional domain for developers to use.

In the meantime
---------------
We have issues to solve, questions to answer, plans to make, and stuff
to organize. Those are organized in [the issues section][2].

We are going to use this repo as a folder for everything (documents) we
need. So we'll be drafting policies, applications, you name it.

So pitch in, create an issue, make a pull request, discuss them! 

Let's get cracking!

Preliminary plan
----------------
* Define the project
* Raise awareness
* Raise money
* Create a managing entity
* Wait for the next round of gTLD applications
* Apply to ICANN
* Get accepted
* Manage the "thing"
